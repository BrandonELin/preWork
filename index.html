  <p>
    I am a recent college graduate of Montclair State university.
    I majored in statistics and minored in computer science.
    I've lived in New Jersey basically my entire life.
    I am the youngest child of my family as the only son after two older sisters.

    I joined this program because while I was attending Montclair, I my interest in computer science had been piqued.
    I really enjoyed being able to make programs that people can use and wanted to learn more about it.
    Unfortunately at this point I had already been over 2 years into my statistics major that it didn't make sense to transition then.
    Since Graduating, I had bad luck trying to find jobs in that field and so I decided to apply for this program.
    I had the time and my career in statistics wasn't progressing so it made sense to me to try to go for what I didn't have the chance to before.
