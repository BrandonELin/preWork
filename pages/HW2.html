  <p>In addition to my hobbies from the last page, I'm also a huge fan of modern takes on mythology.
    Especially when it comes to the work of Neil Gaiman.
    When I was in school, I was particularly fascinated with mythology and would read lot about Greek Gods since our library had many books on it.
    As an adult with ADHD, it has become harder to just sit down and read mythological text books just for fun.
    So many things contradict themselves and so many minute parts are lost to time and to translation.</p>
  <p class="second">It wouldn't be until I was halfway through college would I find something to fill that void.
    Neil Gaiman was an author I wasn't familiar with by name until a show called Good Omens appeared on Amazon Video that I would that name.
    Ironic since before then, I had seen adaptations of his work before then but I hadn't realized it.
    I had watched Coraline as a child and had nightmares about it for weeks and I watched Stardust with my sister and it's still a bit of a fever dream.
    Regardless, I became obsessed with Neil Gaiman's work and looked into him further.
